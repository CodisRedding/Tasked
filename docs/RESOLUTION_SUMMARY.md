# 🎉 .NET SDK Resolution - RESOLVED ✅

## Summary
The MSB4236 "The SDK 'Microsoft.NET.Sdk' specified could not be found" error has been **completely resolved** using the comprehensive solution provided.

## What Was Fixed

### 1. ✅ Root Cause Identified
- **Version Mismatch**: `global.json` specified non-existent SDK version 8.0.404
- **Missing Manifests**: SDK manifests directory was missing/corrupted
- **Resolver Failure**: MSBuild workload resolver couldn't locate SDKs

### 2. ✅ Permanent Solution Applied
```bash
# Added to ~/.zshrc for permanent fix
export MSBuildSDKsPath="/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/$(dotnet --version)/Sdks"
```

### 3. ✅ Project Configuration Fixed
- Updated `global.json` from SDK 8.0.404 → 9.0.301
- Resolved NuGet package version conflicts
- Fixed namespace conflicts with TaskStatus enum
- Added missing Microsoft.Extensions.Http package

### 4. ✅ Build Status
```
✅ Build: SUCCESS
✅ Restore: SUCCESS  
✅ Dependencies: Resolved
✅ Environment: Configured
```

## Files Created/Modified

### Configuration Files
- ✅ `global.json` - Updated SDK version
- ✅ `Tasked.csproj` - Fixed package versions
- ✅ `~/.zshrc` - Added permanent MSBuildSDKsPath

### Source Code Fixes
- ✅ `src/Services/TaskOrchestrationService.cs` - Added TaskStatus alias
- ✅ `src/Services/TaskManagementService.cs` - Added TaskStatus alias  
- ✅ `src/UI/ConsoleInterface.cs` - Fixed namespace conflicts

### Documentation & Tools
- ✅ `fix-dotnet-sdk.sh` - Automated troubleshooting script
- ✅ `SDK_FIX_DOCUMENTATION.md` - Complete fix documentation

## Verification Results

### ✅ Build Test
```bash
❯ dotnet build
Build succeeded with 2 warning(s) in 0.4s
→ bin/Debug/net9.0/Tasked.dll
```

### ✅ Environment Test  
```bash
❯ echo $MSBuildSDKsPath
/usr/local/share/dotnet/sdk/9.0.301/Sdks
```

### ✅ Automated Test
```bash
❯ ./fix-dotnet-sdk.sh
🎉 Fix applied successfully!
✅ Test project builds successfully
```

## Next Steps - Project Ready! 🚀

The **Tasked** application is now fully buildable and ready for:

1. **Configuration Setup** - Use `TODO.md` to configure Jira/BitBucket credentials
2. **Database Initialization** - Run first-time setup to create SQLite database
3. **Testing** - Execute `dotnet run` to start the application
4. **Development** - Continue building features with working build system

## Future-Proofing

The solution is robust and will:
- ✅ Survive .NET SDK updates (dynamic version detection)
- ✅ Work across shell sessions (permanent profile configuration)  
- ✅ Provide troubleshooting tools (automated fix script)
- ✅ Document the solution for team members
