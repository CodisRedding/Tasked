# Development Log

## Project Overview
Tasked is an automated task management system that bridges Jira with repository providers (BitBucket, GitHub, GitLab) to streamline development workflows.

## Recent Development Session (July 19, 2025)

### Major Features Implemented
1. **Progressive Configuration Saving**
   - Setup wizard now saves each section immediately after completion
   - Prevents data loss when setup is interrupted
   - Users can resume setup from where they left off

2. **Smart Configuration Detection**
   - Setup wizard detects existing configurations
   - Offers three-way choice: Keep existing / Update existing / Start fresh
   - Preserves user preferences intelligently

3. **Token Health Monitoring System**
   - Comprehensive API token validation (`dotnet run --token-health`)
   - Token replacement wizard (`dotnet run --update-token`)
   - Proactive expiration warnings and renewal guidance

4. **JQL-Based Task Queries**
   - Replaced manual project key entry with JQL queries
   - Default: `assignee = currentUser() AND status IN ("To Do", "In Progress", "Ready for Development")`
   - More flexible and user-centric approach

5. **BitBucket Workspace Auto-Discovery**
   - API-driven workspace detection with repository counts
   - Eliminates manual workspace name entry
   - Shows workspace popularity for better selection

6. **Improved UI/UX**
   - Changed generic "Repository Configuration" to specific provider names (e.g., "BitBucket Configuration")
   - Better self-documenting placeholder values in `appsettings.json`
   - Added `_README` property and documentation files

### Code Quality Improvements
- Fixed all compiler warnings (null reference, async without await)
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Enhanced progressive saving with JSON merging

### Architecture Decisions
- **Configuration Strategy**: Two-file approach (`appsettings.json` template + `appsettings.local.json` overrides)
- **Security**: Real credentials never committed to git, stored in `.gitignore`d local file
- **Token Management**: File-based storage preferred over database for bootstrap credentials

## Next Development Priorities
1. Complete setup wizard testing with real credentials
2. End-to-end workflow testing (Jira sync → task processing → branch creation)
3. Error handling and edge case testing
4. Documentation completion

## Development Workflow
- Use `dotnet run --setup` for configuration
- Use `dotnet run --token-health` for credential validation
- Progressive saving allows interrupted setup sessions
- All real credentials go in `appsettings.local.json` (never commit this file)

## Key Files
- `src/Setup/SetupWizard.cs` - Main setup orchestration
- `src/Setup/TokenUpdateService.cs` - Token management
- `src/Configuration/AppConfiguration.cs` - Strongly-typed config
- `docs/TODO.md` - User setup guide (not development tasks)
- `appsettings.json` - Template configuration
- `appsettings.local.json` - Real user credentials (gitignored)

## Testing Notes
- Partial configuration in `appsettings.local.json` demonstrates progressive saving
- Setup wizard intelligently handles existing vs. new configurations
- All compiler warnings resolved for clean user experience
